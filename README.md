## 💻 Technologies Used
HTML5 – Semantic structure
CSS3 – Styling and layout
Google Fonts API – Custom typography

## 🖼️ Preview
The page features a left-hand side with a background photo and logo,
while the right-hand side contains a registration form and call-to-action.

Left (Hero Image)	Right (Form Section)
Background image with logo and photographer credit	Sign-up form with custom buttons and styled inputs

## 🧠 How It Works
The .container uses Flexbox to split the layout into two screens.

The .left-screen displays an image with a dark overlay and the site logo.

The .right-screen contains three sections:

Intro Text – Encourages sign-up.

Form Section – Collects user details.

Action Section – "Create Account" button and login link.

## 🎨 Customization
You can easily change:

The background image by replacing images/bastien-nvs-g3CR0UJ1CyM-unsplash.jpg

The logo by updating images/logo.jpg

The color palette in styles.css (look for background-color and accent colors)

Font weight and size through the .alan-sans-regular class
