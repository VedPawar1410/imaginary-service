The .container uses Flexbox to split the layout into two screens.

The .left-screen displays an image with a dark overlay and the site logo.

The .right-screen contains three sections:

Intro Text – Encourages sign-up.

Form Section – Collects user details.

Action Section – "Create Account" button and login link.
